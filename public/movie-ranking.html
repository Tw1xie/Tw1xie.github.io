<h1>The Best Movies According To Tw1xie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>A Beautiful life</h3>
<p>The movie is my favorite of all time, it has the main character as my favorite musician (Christopher). And it's just amazing.</p>

<h3>Never Back Down</h3>
<p>The first Never Back Down movie is a very inspiring and motivating movie. I could rewatch that anyday at anytime!</p>

<h3>Creed</h3>
<p>Like Never Back Down, Creed is an amazing and inspirational movie. I get motivated watching it, and at any day and any time I could watch all the Creed movies</p>
